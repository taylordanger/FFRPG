# FFRPG
FFRPG (Fly Fishing RPG) is a Python-based text adventure that transforms the art of fly fishing into an intricate role-playing game. This project combines fishing simulation with RPG mechanics, creating a unique gaming experience where every decision matters—from your equipment choices to your casting strategy.

Players assume the role of a fisherman who must master the complexities of fly fishing through strategic equipment selection and tactical field positioning. The game features a comprehensive equipment system where you customize your fishing setup by building leaders with various line types and lengths, selecting or constructing fly rods based on material and length specifications, and designing custom flies tailored to different fishing conditions.

The game employs a sophisticated two-grid interface that provides both underwater and surface perspectives. The "fishfinder" view reveals the underwater terrain and fish positions (represented by '0'), while the "overhead" view shows the surface water conditions and obstacles (represented by '.'). This dual perspective creates strategic depth as players must analyze both views to determine optimal casting positions.

Progression & Complexity: True to its design philosophy of "making it as complicated as possible," FFRPG features a leveling system with experience points earned through successful catches. Players track their total fish count and advance through increasingly challenging fishing locations, each with unique terrain patterns and fish behaviors.

Technical Implementation: Built in Python, FFRPG uses ASCII-based graphics to create an immersive terminal experience. The 10x10 grid system provides tactical positioning gameplay reminiscent of classic strategy games, while the character-based interface ensures compatibility across platforms.

Whether you're a fishing enthusiast or RPG fan, FFRPG offers a uniquely challenging experience that rewards patience, and planning.
